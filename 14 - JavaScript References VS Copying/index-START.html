    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team = players.slice();
    team[1] = 'Andy';
    console.log(team, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    team2[1] = 'Amy';
    console.log(team2, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = Array.from(players);
    team3[1] = 'Alice';
    console.log(team3, players);

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[1] = 'April';
    console.log(team4, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const man = Object.assign({}, person);
    man.gender = 'male';
    console.log(person, man);
